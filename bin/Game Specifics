Game Rules:
First player to 50 kills wins.
Higher the killstreak, the higher the reward, but the more damage you take. Killstreaks end when killed. Killstreaks go up to 8.
3 Supply drops are dropped every 2 minutes around the map, granting potions or food. Killing a 3-tier class as a 2-tier gives an extra ruby, 
doing so as a 1-tier gives 2 extra rubies. There are many challenges that reward players with Rubies or even Stars. Once every 3 minutes, a
'scapegoat' is chosen randomly. That player's coordinates are put in chat, and each other player gets a compass pointing to them. A player
with more kills is more likely to become Scapegoat. That player is sorrounded by red particles, but gets double rewards for kills and killstreaks.
3 minute timer starts from when the last scapegoat was killed. Strategy is reccomended, because at the end, your kills are divided by your
deaths and that is the extra amount of rubies you get. A player who suicides and spams kills will get the least reward by the end. A winner
with under under 20 deaths gets a small amount of stars at the end of the game. 


Each kit has 3 tiers that can be unlocked by acquiring rubies (through winning, kills, killstreaks and missions) or completing various
achievements as the kit of the previous tier. Enderblade is locked until any 3rd-tier kit is unlocked. 
You can 'ascend' a 3rd-tier kit to gain a Class (Shown as roman numerals next to your name). Resets the kit, but not the acheivements.
Each Class gives you Stars and a unique perk is acquired every 3 Classes. A unique cosmetic is unlocked every 5, starting at the first. Unique
perks are not powerful at all, but are universal no matter the kit. 

Stars are earned by donating, gaining a Class, and occasionally by completely challenges. They can be spent on Cosmetics and Class Perks.
